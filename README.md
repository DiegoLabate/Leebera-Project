# Leebera-Machine
Leebera is a project with the aim to reduce the electronic waste, reducing the harm of the (programmed or not) appliances obsolescence. We all know the scene when our washing machine isn't working anymore and our mom or our wife tell you the news! In the first seconds we are pervaded with a sense of discomfort. So, we have two options, but the first one is to repair it. Imagine you found that the fault is on the machine's electronic board. Imagine also that this board is a bit too much expensive compared to a new appliance or (as is the case), the board is not anymore on the market. So, this is when Leebera come on.
In the above case, we would like to provide new life at our appliance, just because we don't want to add 70Kg of waste to the land or just because we love it and don't want to buy a new one. Leebera project would like to give the point let our appliances to become smart too, as like as the Firestick(c) of Amazon(c) with old TV.

We don't have the effort to produce a video just now, so as in the following video we are triyng to develop a solution for the appliance like Washing Machine, Fridge, Dishwasher, etc.

First to throw away your washing machine, with 70kg of material in the environment, we do the last chance at our appliance.

# Leebera-Machine
Leebera is a project with the aim to reduce the electronic waste, limiting the (programmed or not) appliances obsolescence.
We provide a solution to give new life at your appliance, let him to become smart too, like the Firestick(c) of Amazon(c) with old TV.
Consumers aren’t the only losers here, the environment is too. Independent repairers plan a crucial role in reducing unnecessary electrical waste, and often perform repairs that manufacturers aren’t doing themselves.

We don't have the effort to produce a video just now, so as in the following video we are triyng to develop a solution for the appliance like Washing Machine, Fridge, Dishwasher, etc.

First to throw away your washing machine, with 70kg of material in the environment, we do the last chance at our appliance.

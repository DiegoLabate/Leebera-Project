We all know the scene when our washing machine or our fridge broke and our mom or our wife tell us the news when we are at work! At the begin we are pervaded with a sense of discomfort. We know we have two options, and the most likely is not to repair it. And I want explain you why.

Imagine the fault is on the machine's electronic main board. Imagine also that the board's price included labour is a more expensive than to buy a new appliance or (as often is the case), the main board is not anymore on the market. So, this is what Leebera want avoid.

Our mission is to extend the life of our appliance, just because we and you don't want to add 70-80 Kg of e-waste to the land or just because we still love it and don't want to buy a new one. Leebera is designing a new way to do it. We put the repairing problem in the design phase: repairable "by design". 

Just now we cannot put in place the effort to produce a video (someone interested :)? ), but the problem is well explained here:

First to throw away your washing machine, dishwater or your fridge, putting 70kg-80Kg of materials in the landfill, think twice and contact us!

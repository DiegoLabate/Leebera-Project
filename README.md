# Leebera-Machine
Leebera is a project with the aim to reduce the electronic waste, limiting the (programmed or not) appliances obsolescence.
Consumers aren’t the only losers here, the environment is too. Independent repairers plan a crucial role in reducing unnecessary electrical waste, and often perform repairs that manufacturers aren’t doing themselves.

We don't have the effort to produce a video just now, so as in the following video we are triyng to develop a solution for the appliance like Washing Machine, Fridge, Dishwasher, etc.

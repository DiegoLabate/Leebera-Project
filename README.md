# Leebera-Machine
Leebera is a project with the aim to reduce the electronic waste, limiting the harm of the (programmed or not) appliances obsolescence. We all know the scene when our washing machine isn't working anymore and our mom or our wife tell you the news! In the first seconds we are pervaded with a sense of discomfort. So, we have two options, but the first one is to repair it. Imagine you found that the fault is on the machine's electronic board. Imagine also that this board is a bit too much expensive compared to the new appliance or (as often is the case), the board is not anymore on the market. So, this is when Leebera come in.

We would like to extend the life of our appliance, just because we don't want to add 70Kg of waste to the land or just because we still love it and don't want to buy a new one. Leebera project is designing a new way to do it. We put the repairing problem in the design phase. Repairable by design. 

We don't have the effort to produce a video just now, so in the following video you will have an idea to what we are talking for to develop a solution for the appliance like Washing Machine, Fridge, Dishwasher, etc.

First to throw away your washing machine, with 70kg of material in the environment, think to it two times!
